# Codebook for Course Project 

File: outfile.txt

Obtained by: applying script run_analysis.R to the Samsung UCI HAR Dataset

Location: Data\UCI HAR Dataset\

Columns: 

	Meaning: each columns contains values for a particular combination (subject,activity)
		 e.g. "1.Laying" means values for subject #1 for the activity laying down
		      "7.Sitting" means values for subject #7 for the activity sitting down

	Number: there are as many columns as there are combinations subject x activity type


Row: 	Meaning: each row corresponds to a particular feature obtained during training or test runs
		 e.g. fBodyAcc-std()-Y is the feature that corresponds with standard deviation for
		      acceleration of the body in the Y direction. 
		 Note however that these feature values are not part of the resulting file.
		 The names of these features have been listed below for reference purposes

	Number of these: 79


Cells:  Every cell contains the mean of a particular feature (as defined by the row) for a particular
 	combination of (subject,activity) (as defined by the columns), calculated across the HAR dataset

Reference: list of features retained from the dataset
